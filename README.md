# Backpropagation
trying to get the Neural network working

It seems the Net is stuck in local minima but I might be wrong. Cant seem to find the bug :'(

mse - Mean Squared Error.

After increasing the amount of nodes in hidden layer of the neural network it finally gave me an mse of 0.001.
I added 6 more nodes and it took roughly 100,000 iteration maybe less to get 0.001 mse.
